<h1>HACC Compression Study</h1>




<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>
For convenience reasons, we provided a build scripts. Simply call the following 
commands in the project's root directory, with <code>BUILD_TYPE</code> being 
either <code>Release</code> or <code>Debug</code> and the default value being 
<code>Release</code>.
<pre><code>./config.sh &lt;BUILD_TYPE&gt;
./build.sh
</code></pre>
The cmake output will be stored under <code>./binary/</code>. The outputs will 
be installed under <code>./build/</code>. Both folders are included in the 
<code>.gitignore</code> file. The clean script can be called to remove all of 
the directories generated by the commands above.
<pre><code>./clean.sh</code></pre>
</p>




<h2>Running Programs</h2>

<p>
For the same reasons as above, we provide sbatch scripts to execute the different programs.
These scripts can be found under <code>&lt;PROJECT_ROOT&gt;/build/run</code>.
The development scripts can be found under <code>&lt;PROJECT_ROOT&gt;/run</code>.
Some of the scripts might need some adjustments.
We suggest to perform those adjustments to the scripts in the build folder and not to the development scripts in the run folder.
Below, we will list the call options for each script:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<b>GIO wrapper test</b><br>
		<pre><code>sbatch gio_test.sh &lt;PATH_TO_HACC_OUTPUT_FILE&gt;</code></pre>
	</li>
</ul>
